        <p>Before you begin your journey, we advise you to read what you can see below. Basically, it can help you understand better the difference between a:</p>

        <h2>CUT</h2>
        <p>A cut (a.k.a caloric deficit) means that you consume less calories than you burn, in order to lose weight. A cut is best done when you are reducing your daily calorie intake by 400-500 calories, while getting a healthy amount of protein too. In order to know your actual calorie intake while bulking, start off by calculating your maintenance calories. You can find a calculator which can help you <a href="Maintenance calorie calculator.html"><button style="font-size: 20px; border-radius: 25px;">right here</button></a>.</p>

        <h3>and</h3>

        <h2>BULK</h2><p>A bulk (a.k.a caloric surplus) is the exact opposite of a cut. You eat more calories than you burn, in order to gain weight. A healthy approach to bulking is when you eat some lean, healthy meals. Increasing your daily caloric intake by 400-500 calories, can definetely help you on the bulking phase. <a href="Maintenance calorie calculator.html"><button style="font-size: 15px; border-radius: 25px;">This calculator</button></a> can help you this time as well, in order to determine you daily caloric intake.</p>

        <p>Now, you should know about the other things you need to consider when eating controlled and healthy, and that is: macronutrients. The macronutrients (a.k.a macros) are essential for a healthy diet. Macronutrients play an important role in the body's energy levels and overall structure. There are three types of macronutrients: fats, carbohydrates and proteins. By pressing on the buttons below, you will understand each of their roles much better.</p>
        
        <h4>Fats</h4>
        <p>Fats for the human body are exactly the same as fuel for the car's engine. Fats are used to build hormones, cells and nerve tissues.</p>
        <h4>Carbohydrates</h4>
        <p>Carbohydrates (fiber, starches and sugars) are used by the human body by transforming them into glucose, resulting energy. There are two types of carbohydrates: simple and complex. Simple carbs could be: sodas, sweets, cookies, fast food, white bread etc. While complex carbs are the: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, brown rice etc. Simple carbs are known to be more easily digestible for the body, the complex carbs are the exact opposite. They take longer to digest because they aren't processed and they are higher in fiber, vitamins and minerals.</p>
        <h4>Proteins</h4>
        <p>Proteins are the molecules that used to repair cells and of course, build muscle. The process which builds the muscles is known as protein synthesis.</p>
