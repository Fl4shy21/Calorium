    <p1>The following workout plans/splits are designed after Mike Mentzer's Heavy Duty method. It is well known in the bodybuilding industry because of the controversy behind it. Many people underestimate this way of training, because it only requires one set per exercise. That one set is done until momentary muscular fatigue sets in. According to Mike Mentzer, this way of training is the specially designed for natural lifters.</p>

        <p2>Now, here's something important you got to know. All these sets, on each exercises, on each days, must be done with heavy weight. Each set must consist of 6-10 repetitions, depends on your capabilities. Performing all these sets with light weight won't benefit you almost at all. Also, make sure that you take your time in order to execute the positive, static and negative movements when doing any exercise. 2-3 seconds on each part of a rep will most likely contract your muscles better.</p2>
        <hr>
        <p3>When talking about abdominal workouts, you shouldn't perform them every single day. In this way, you're putting too much effort and strain on your abdominals, causing you back or/and abdominal pain. In most cases, there isn't need for any kinds of abdominal exercises, as the Heavy Duty style requires effort from the abdominals when working any of the upper/lower body muscle groups.</p3>
        <hr>
        <p4>On the other hand, you can train you forearms on the Back-Biceps day (or Pull day). The forearms are responsible for both pulling movements and flexing the biceps. In case you aren't satisfied with your forearms size/thickness, you can train them after completing your main goals in the workout. You do not even need such a big weight in order to grow your forearms. Selecting a moderate-a little bit heavier weight for training forearms can be perfect, following this way: </p4>
        <table>
            <tr bgcolor="crimson" align="center">
                <th>Forearms</th>
            </tr>
            <tr bgcolor="lightblue">
                <td>Cable wrist Curl (1 * failure)</td>
                <td>Reverse wrist curl (1 * failure)</td>
            </tr>
